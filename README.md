What? One stop place to keep track of takeaways from your reading (both hard and digital). 
This is radically different than pure note taking or highlighting. For example, one book read by 5 folks can have five different learnings because it is very personal to each one of them as everybody sees the world differently. 

How? Securely organize and manage learnings in your personal online account. 

Why? Reflections of learnings from your reading gives you a very personal experience that can you go and revisit over time or reading them again.
